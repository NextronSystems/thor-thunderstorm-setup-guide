Maintenance
===========

Location of the Components
--------------------------

THOR Thunderstorm uses several components and paths for the configuration.
Please see the table below for more information:

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30, 70

   * - Component
     - Path
   * - Config
     - /etc/thunderstorm/thunderstorm.yml
   * - Binaries & Signatures
     - /opt/nextron/thunderstorm
   * - Logs
     - /var/log/thunderstorm (you can change that in the configuration)
   * - Sample Files
     - /tmp/thunderstorm (you can change that in the configuration)

Restart the Service
-------------------

The following command will restart the THOR Thunderstorm service:

.. code-block:: console 

   nextron@thunder:~$ sudo systemctl restart thor-thunderstorm.service

.. warning:: 
   Only restart the service if you are sure that no samples are in the queue.
   The queue will get deleted once the service restarts, so only use this if
   you are sure that no samples get lost.

Review the Service Status
-------------------------

To debug potential problems, you can run the following commands and
see what might be the problem.

Check if the service is still running:

.. code-block:: console 

   nextron@thunder:~$ sudo systemctl status thor-thunderstorm.service
   [sudo] password for nextron:
   ‚óè thor-thunderstorm.service - THOR Thunderstorm Server
      Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/thor-thunderstorm.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
      Active: active (running) since Wed 2023-01-18 15:28:17 CET; 17h ago
   Main PID: 39960 (thor-linux-64)

Check the last entries in the service log for errors

.. code-block:: console 

   nextron@thunder:~$ tail /var/log/thunderstorm/thunderstorm.log

Check if the service is listening on a port:

.. code-block:: console 

   nextron@thunder:~$ sudo netstat -anpt | grep thor

Update
------

There are two methods on how to update THOR Thunderstorm.

The first method will only update the signatures. This is
the safer option, since the service will not be restarted
automatically.

.. code-block:: console
   :emphasize-lines: 9

   user@unix:~$ sudo thunderstorm-update
   [...]
   Mar 21 15:54:21 unix THOR_UTIL: Info: Starting Upgrade Process

   Mar 21 15:54:21 unix THOR_UTIL: Info: already up-to-date
   Successfully updated signatures
   Now restart the Thunderstorm service at the next opportunity with: sudo systemctl restart thor-thunderstorm
   Note: Use './thunderstorm-update full' to upgrade the binaries and signatures (warning: it will also restart the service automatically)

The second method will also update the signatures and the
THOR Thunderstorm binary. This should only be used when you
are sure that the sample queue is empty and no samples are
being scanned at the moment!

Replace the License
-------------------

In order to add a new license, copy it to the ``/etc/thunderstorm/`` directory. 

The THOR Thunderstorm service will automatically pick the first valid license and use it. 

.. note:: 
   If you've added a license with a higher quota limit (samples per hour) and the
   old one has not expired, you have to remove the old license, so that the
   Thunderstorm service cannot select and use it.
